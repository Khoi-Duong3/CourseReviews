However, academic papers and textbooks are written by humans who have their own perspectives, biases and agendas; often, the behind-the-scenes story is even more interesting. While exploring an eclectic mix of fascinating topics with short modules from working academics from a range of fields, we will explore the history, philosophy, controversies, and applications of the scholarly pursuit. In this course, students will experience an expanded view of the nature of evidence-based practices, gain in-depth knowledge of contemporary research questions that scholars at McMaster University are exploring, and learn to become informed and critical consumers of information and media.

These processes sometimes feel far away from our everyday lives and struggles in the workplace. How have these processes impacted the lives of workers in both the Global North and Global South? How have they shaped prospects for resistance? How have workers and workers organizations responded to these challenges? In this course we will examine how globalization has shaped the lives of workers, working conditions, working class politics and democracy. We will also explore how workers have been developing strategies to challenge these processes, including forms of international labour solidarity, transnational union coordination as well as union coordination with unorganized, informal and unemployed workers and social movements.
